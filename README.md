This is a working in progress of Kata BankOCR. 
I wrote it to craft my TDD, Test and OO programming skills. 

I started to write it right after I finish Growing Object Oriented Software, 
Guided by test, trying my best to use what I've learned.

It not perfect so feel free to change it, and write better ways to implement it.

# KataBankOCR
